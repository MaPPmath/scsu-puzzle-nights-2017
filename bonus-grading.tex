\phWorksheet{Bonus Puzzle 3 - GRADING}

To grade this Bonus Puzzle, confirm that the circled numbers yield no reactions
with one another. Since reactions are symmetric, it suffices to only check
if each number reacts with a greater number. The below chart only shows those
reactions; you can skip numbers in parentheses as they only react with
lesser numbers.

  \begin{multicols}{3}\small
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{01:} 03, 11, 18
    \item \textbf{02:} 04, 21
    \item \textbf{03:} 30
    \item \textbf{04:} 19
    \item \textbf{05:} 06, 07, 15
    \item \textbf{06:} 19, 30
    \item \textbf{07:} 10
    \item \textbf{08:} 13, 25, 27
    \item \textbf{09:} 12, 16, 23
    \item \textbf{10:} 15
    \item \textbf{11:} 17
    \item \textcolor{lightgray}{(12)}
    \item \textbf{13:} 14, 26
    \item \textcolor{lightgray}{(14)}
    \item \textbf{15:} 28
    \item \textcolor{lightgray}{(16)}
    \item \textbf{17:} 23, 30
    \item \textbf{18:} 20
    \item \textbf{19:} 22
    \item \textbf{20:} 23

    \item \textcolor{lightgray}{(22)}
    \item \textcolor{lightgray}{(23)}
    \item \textbf{24:} 26
    \item \textbf{25:} 29
    \item \textcolor{lightgray}{(26)}
    \item \textbf{27:} 28
    \item \textcolor{lightgray}{(28)}
    \item \textcolor{lightgray}{(29)}
    \item \textcolor{lightgray}{(30)}
  \end{itemize}
  \end{multicols}

If the set is legal, then record how many numbers were used. The team(s)
with the largest cardinality are awarded VP for this puzzle.
