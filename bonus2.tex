\phWorksheet{Bonus Puzzle 2}

Awesome! Did you figure out how to roll two of the dice in every picture,
  or did you find a way to identify which dice movements were impossible?

  Suppose one of those dice was positioned on the \(8\times 8\) grid
  as below. How many different positions and orientations can the die
  be legally moved into by rolling (as in the main puzzle)?
  Report your best guess to Game HQ, and the team(s)
  closest to the correct answer will earn \(50\) bonus points!
