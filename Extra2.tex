\phWorksheet{Extra Puzzle 2}

Tina's invited a couple friends over to play a board game, but they
can't decide who gets to go first. Tina suggests that they should choose
three dice from the following strange collection:

\begin{itemize}
\item Die A has sides labeled [1, 27, 38, 41, 43, 46]
\item Die B has sides labeled [2, 10, 45, 56, 57, 59]
\item Die C has sides labeled [3, 12, 24, 34, 36, 50]
\item Die D has sides labeled [4, 28, 30, 44, 54, 58]
\item Die E has sides labeled [5, 15, 20, 25, 33, 39]
\item Die F has sides labeled [6, 18, 21, 26, 32, 55]
\item Die G has sides labeled [7, 19, 31, 49, 51, 53]
\item Die H has sides labeled [8, 14, 17, 22, 40, 60]
\item Die I has sides labeled [9, 11, 16, 35, 42, 47]
\item Die J has sides labeled [13, 23, 29, 37, 48, 52]
\end{itemize}

Each player will throw one of the three chosen dice, and the player rolling
the highest goes first. If the combination is ``Go-First fair'', then each player has an equal chance of going first. However, most of the
above dice combinations are unfair: out of dice ABC, B wins \(134\) of the
outcomes, A only wins \(51\) outcomes, and C wins just \(31\).

Submit a combination of the three above dice which you think is Go-First fairest.
\textbf{The team(s) submitting the fairest combination of dice
will receive \(50\) Victory Points.} By the way, a perfect combination of
Go First Dice was first
invented in 2010 by puzzle designer Eric Harshbarger and mathematician
Dr. Robert Ford. Tina is certain she has that exact set lying around somewhere...
